--Follow the instructions below to complete Deliverable 1.

--Retrieve the emp_no, first_name, and last_name columns from the Employees table.
--Retrieve the title, from_date, and to_date columns from the Titles table.
--Create a new table using the INTO clause.
--Join both tables on the primary key.
--Filter the data on the birth_date column to retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Then, order by the employee number.

SELECT e.emp_no,
       e.first_name,
       e.last_name,
       t.title,

ON (e.emp_no = t.emp_no)
WHERE (e.birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
order by e.emp_no;
--Export the Retirement Titles table from the previous step as retirement_titles.csv and save it to your Data folder in the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis folder.

-- Use the DISTINCT ON statement to retrieve the first occurrence of the employee number for each set of rows defined by the ON () clause.
--Exclude those employees that have already left the company by filtering on to_date to keep only those dates that are equal to '9999-01-01'.
--Create a Unique Titles table using the INTO clause.
--Sort the Unique Titles table in ascending order by the employee number and descending order by the last date (i.e., to_date) of the most recent title.

SELECT DISTINCT ON (emp_no) emp_no,
first_name,
last_name,
title
INTO unique_titles
FROM retirement_titles
WHERE to_date = ('9999-01-01')
ORDER BY emp_no, to_date DESC;

-- Write another query in the Employee_Database_challenge.sql file to retrieve the number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire.
--First, retrieve the number of titles from the Unique Titles table.
--Then, create a Retiring Titles table to hold the required information.
--Group the table by title, then sort the count column in descending order.

SELECT COUNT(ut.title), ut.title
INTO retiring_titles
FROM unique_titles as ut
GROUP BY ut.title
